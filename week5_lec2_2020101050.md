## DYNAMIC PROGRAMMING

### SHORTEST PATH IN DIRECTED ACYCLIC GRAPH
One weighted directed acyclic graph is given (There will be no cycle and the directions from one vertex to other is given so it is directed). Another source vertex is also provided.
Now we have to find the shortest distance from the starting node to all other vertices, in the graph.

For Shortest paths we have three algorithms Dikjstra Algorithm which does not work for negative weighted edges , Bellman ford Algorithm also for negative weigtted edges
, for shortest distance from every single vertex to other verted we have floyd warshell whose complexity is O(n^3) so it 
works well only for small size of graphs.

#### Dijkstra Algorithm
```bash
constexpr ll inf = 1e18;
void dijkstra(vector<vector<pii>> g, int s, vector<ll> &d)
{
   typedef pair<ll, int> T;
   priority_queue<T, vector<T>, greater<T>> q;
   for (q.push({0, s}); !q.empty(); q.pop())
   {
      ll curd = q.top().first;
      int i = q.top().second;
      if (d[i] != inf)
         continue;
      d[i] = curd;
      trav(p, g[i]) q.push({curd + p.second, p.first});
   }
}
```

Dijkstra's algorithm does not work with negative edge weights. For instance, consider the following graph (assume the edges are all directed from left to right):

       2
    A-----B
     \   /
    3 \ / -2
       C

If we start with A, Dijkstra's algorithm will choose the edge (A,x) minimizing d(A,A)+length(edge), namely (A,B). It then sets d(A,B) = 2 and chooses another edge (y,C) minimizing
 d(A,y)+d(y,C); the only choice is (A,C) and it sets d(A,C)=3. But it never finds the shortest path from A to B, via C, with total length 1. 

#### TOPOLOGICAL SORT 

Topological sorting of vertices of a Directed Acyclic Graph is an ordering of the vertices v1,v2,v3.....vn
 in such a way, that if there is an edge directed towards vertex from vertex , then comes before .


       
    A---->B---->>D
     \    |    /
      \   |   /
       \  |  /
        \ | /
         >C------->E

Topo sort order is A->B->C->D->E 

Code for Toplogical sorting

```bash
vector<int>res;

vector<int>arr[1000];

void topsort(int n)
{
    queue<int>q;
    for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++)
    {
    
        if(in[i]==0)
        q.push(i);

    }
    while (!q.empty())
    {
        int curr = q.front();
        res.push_back(curr);

        q.pop();
        for (int node: arr[curr])
        {
          in[node]--;
          if(in[node]==0)
          q.push(node);
        }  
    }  
}
```
Algorithm 1:

    for each vertex y in sorted order by d(s,y)
    let (x,y) be an edge with x already processed,
        minimizing d(s,x)+length(x,y)
    path(s,y) = path(s,x) + edge (x,y)
    d(s,y) = d(s,x) + length(x,y)

Define a topological ordering of a directed graph to be one in which, whenever we have an edge from x to y, the ordering visits x before y. If we can define such an ordering, then we can do something like algorithm 1, and be sure that the predecessor of a vertex x is always processed before we process x itself.


Algorithm 2: (shortest paths from topological order)

    for each vertex y in a topological ordering of G
    choose edge (x,y) minimizing d(s,x)+length(x,y)
    path(s,y) = path(s,x) + edge (x,y)
    d(s,y) = d(s,x) + length(x,y)
This runs in linear time (with the possible exception of finding the ordering), and works even when the graph has negative length edges. You can even use it to find longest paths: just negate the lengths of all the edges.
 The only issue is that it only works when we can find a topological ordering.And there is a theorem which states
  #### Theorem:
  A graph has a topological ordering if and only if it is a directed acyclic graph.
