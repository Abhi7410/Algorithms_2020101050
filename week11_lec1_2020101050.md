## Three polarizer photon experiment:
- Let there be two polarizer A and C at 90 degree angle.
- Then the light that reaches at the other end from the light source is negligible.
- Now introduce a third polarizer, say B, which is at 45 degree angle from A in clockwise direction and 45 degree anticlockwise from polarizer C.
- The intensity of light that reaches the other end of the source, is now 1/8th the original intensity.
- This cannot be explained using classical mechanics.

## Postulates of quantum mechanics:
- Superposition postulate:
  - State vector in Hilbert space, Tensor analysis.
- Measurement and collapse postulates;
  - Projections, inner-products etc.
- Evolution postulate;
  - Schrodinger equation, unitary transformations etc.

## Qubits:
- There are different than bits which are either 0 or 1.
- Qubits are the superposition of all the possible outcomes.
- Qubit is a unit vector in a 2-D complex vector space.
- Qubits can be in a superposition of |0> and |1> such as a|0> + b|1>.
- a and b are complex numbers such that |a|^2 + |b|^2 = 1.
- Qubit model correctly predicts the outcome of above photon experiment.

## Nocloning theorem:
- Assume that U is a unitary transformation that clones, in that U(|a0›) = |aa› for all quantum states |a›.
- Consider |c› = (1/√2)(|a› + |b›).
- Then, U(|c0›) = 1/√2 (U(|a0›) + U(|b0›)) = 1/√2(|aa› + |bb›)
- But if U is a cloning transformation then U(|c0›) = |cc› = 1/2(|aa› + |ab› + |ba› + |bb›) which is a contradiction.

## Multiple Quibits: 
- When we have multiple quibts we can see that there 2^n possible outcomes.

- Say we have a hydragen atom , we can say that for this atom its electron can be in excited state or in ground state. Quantum mechanics says that it can be in the superposition of these 2 states. For 1 mole of hydrogen there are 6x10^23 atoms . So the nature has to book keep  2 to the power so many values to know the state . Doing this with the help of a computer takes very long but we can see that the nature does this extemely fast. 
- Sometimes our computer can calculate the outcome faster than the nature itself say for example a projectile , if we give all the required input for a projectie we can precicely tell where the projectie lands even  before the projectile physically lands there but it this is not true in some other cases . In such cases rather than perforing the computaion on the computer which will take a huge amount of time to claculate it is betyter that we look at the corresponding example in nature and cjeck what outcome it produces and that would be the answer to our question. But now the question remains how do we know which natural phemonon to observe for a particular computation.
- Any unitary transformation can be approximated by the connection of few basic unitary transformations. 

## Quantum teleportation:
- The objective is to transmit the quantum state of a particle using classical bits and reconstruct the exact quantum state at the receiver.
- Does not contradict no-cloning theorem.
- Alice has a qubit whose state she doesn’t know. She wants to send the state of this qubit φ = a|0›  + b|1› to Bob through classical channels.
- Alice and Bob each possess one qubit of an entangled pair ψ0 = 1/√2(|00› + |11›)
- Do some quantum computations and mathematics as discussed in the lecture.
- Alice measures the first two qubits
- She obtains one of the four outputs with equal probability. Alice sends the result of her  measurement as two classical bits to Bob
- When Bob receives the two classical bits from Alice he knows how the state of his half of the entangled pair compares to the original state of Alice’s qubit.
- Bob can reconstruct the original state of Alice’s qubit, φ, by applying the appropriate decoding transformation to his part of the entangled pair
