# GREEDY ALGORITHM

- GREEDY CHOICE PROPERTY
  
The choice made by a greedy algorithm may depend on choices made
 so far, but not on future choices or all the solutions to the subproblem.

- OPTIMUM SUBSTRUCTURE PROPERTY
  
  An optimal global solution contains the optimal solutions of all its subproblems.


## ACTIVITY SELECTION

This is used many classic problems when there is starting and finishing time given in the question
for any particular work. For example we can think it as sheduled time and you have to choose as many as
events possible .
```bash
                   event        starting time         ending time
                   A             1                     3
                   B             2                     5
                   C             3                     9
                   D             6                     8
```
We can invent several greedy algorithms for the problem but which of them works in every case?
This we decide using two above peoperties

#### Algorithms 1:

- The first idea is to select as short ecents as possible. 
- However selecting short events is not always a correct strategy 
- So this one will not work as it can give wrong answer.

#### Algorithm 2:
- The another idea is to always select the next possible event that begins as early as 
possible.
```bash
      |     1    |
         |     2    |
            |       3          |
                      |   4 |
```
- But we find a counter example for this algorithm, which will give wrong answer. For example, in the below case
according to this algorithm this will count one in three.

              |            1                |
                 |     2     |
                               |   3     |

 The earlest one is 1 and if we choose first one we will not be able to choose others two.
 but they can be chosen if we think differntly.

 #### Algorithm 3:
- The third idea is to always select the next possible event that ends as ealry as
possible. This algorithms selcts the following events
```bash
               |       1       |
                      |       2        |
                              |                3          |
                                          |   4    |
````
It turns out that this algorithms always produce optimal solution. The reason for this is that it 
always an optimal choice to first select an event that ends as early as possible . After this it is an optimalchoice to first select an event
using the same strategu etc intil we cannot select any more events.


## HUFFMAN CODES

This greedy algorithm is used to compress strings using binary digits. We normally convert all the
letters into their ASCII values but this takes a lot of space and this also not optimised.
So we count the frequency of all the letters present in the string and choose the least two and add them 
and do this till we cover all the distinct letter on the basis of their frequency.

The method is very clean we make a binary tree and give the left nodes to be 0 and right node edges to be 1
and start from first to the that frequency letter by traversing the edges. We understand this by an example.

``` bash
    string str = "ABCDEABCDEAAABBBCDBAABCBAA"
              COUNT(A) = 9
              COUNT(B) = 8
              COUNT(C) = 4
              COUNT(D) = 3
              COUNT(E) = 2
```
```bash
                    26
                /         \
               9            \
             /   \           \
            5      \          17
           /  \      \      /    \
          2    3     4     8      9
         E     D      C     B      A 

```
So we assign left node edges to be 0 and right ones to be 1.
Now we can see the compressed code for each letter.
```bash
      E = 000     (3)*2
      D = 001     (3)*3
      C = 01      (2)*4
      B = 10      (2)*8
      A = 11      (2)*9
```
So total  = ASCII values of 5 character(8*5) + 58 + 12

So we saw two examples of above two peopeties , we can code for huffman code using min heaps and all.
