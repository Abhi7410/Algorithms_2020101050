## COUNTABILITY AND COMPUTABILITY
*COUNTABLE SETS:- An Infinite set is countable if there exists bijection N->S
*A set A is coutnable if there exist a Turing machine M which behave as follows:
      M(x) ={1 if x belongs to A
            {0 if x !belongs to A
 examples: the primes
           the fibonacci numbers
           most of the sets are computable
           
 COUNTABLE
  *examples:The set of finite length bit strings {0,1}* are counable
            *This we can easliy prove by showing every natural number as a representaion of binary no. and every representation if going to be different
            so it will be bijection and so countable.
 
 UNCOUNTABLE
 *The set which is not countable is uncountable
 *examples: The power set of binary strings P({0,1}*) is uncountable
            *This we proved using cantor fiablical diagonal argument
            *Given any set S, consider the power set T=P(S) consisting of all subsets of S. Cantor's diagonal method can be used to show that T is larger than S, 
            i.e., there exists an injection but no bijection from S to T. Finding an injection is trivial, as can be seen by considering the function from S to T 
            which maps an element s of S to the singleton set {s}. Suppose there exists a bijection phi from S to T and consider the subset D of S consisting of 
            the elements d of S such that phi(d) does not contain d. Since phi is a bijection, there must exist an element x of S such that phi(x)=D.
            But by the definition of D, the set D contains x if and only if phi(x)=D does not contain x. This yields a contradiction, so there cannot exist a bijection from S to T.
 
 TURING MAHCINE
  *A Turing machine, like an algorithm, executes on an input string of bits. At the beginning, the input string is written on the tape, the tape head points to the first cell of the string, 
  and all other cells are blank.
