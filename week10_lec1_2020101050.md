## Examples of NP completeness

###  Vertex Cover problem:-
  - If G is an undirected graph, a vertex cover of G is a subset of the nodes.
  - Every edge of G touches one of those nodes.
  - This problem asks whether a graph contains a vertex cover of a specified size:
  - Vextex-Cover = { <G,k> | G is an undirected graph that has a k-node vertex cover}.

**- Proof that vertex cover is in NP-**
 
 If any problem in NP then goven a certificate tothe problem and an instance of the prblem ( a graph G and a positive integer k in this case), we will be able
 to check whether the solution given is correct or not, the solution or certificate
 in polynomial time.

 The solution for the vertex cover problem is a subset V' of V which contains the vertices in the vertex cover. We can cover whether
 the set V' is a vertex cover of size k using the following strategy:
 ```
  let count be an integer 
     set count to 0
     for each v in V'
       remove all efge adjacent to v from set E 
       count++
       if count == l and E is empty
       then  the given solution is correct
       else 
              the solution is wrong
  ```
  This can be done in polynomial time thus the vertex cover problem is in class NP.

  **It is NP Hard**

  - Consider the clique problem, which is NP complete => NP hard also.
  - Consider the problem of finding out whether there is a clique of size k in the given graph.
  - An instance of the clique problem is a graph G (V, E) and a non-negative integer k.
  - To check:- Existence of a clique of size k in G.
  - Consider the graph G’ which consists of all edges not in G, but in the complete graph using all vertices in G.
  - Size of clique k in G
  - Set of vertices in the clique is V'.
  - In the complement graph G’, let us pick any edge (u, v). Then at least one of u or v must be in the set V – V’. 
  - This means that the edge (u, v) is in G which is not possible since (u, v) is not in G.
  - Thus, all edges in G’ are covered by vertices in the set V – V’.
  - Similarly, we can say this for V'' of size |V| - k in G'.
  - Thus, we can say that there is a clique of size k in graph G if and only if there is a vertex cover of size |V| – k in G’.
  - Any instance of the clique problem can be reduced to an instance of the vertex cover problem. 
  - Thus the vertex cover problem is in both NP and NP hard classes, and hence, NP complete.  


  ## Subset Sum Problem
  Given N non neg integers a1,a2,a3....an and a target sum K the task is to decide there is a subset having a sum 
  equal to K.  No polynomial-time algorithm is known but surely there exist a magical lucky algorithm which can do this problem in polynomial time. 

  **It is NP**
  
  If any problem is in NP, then given a certificate, which is a solution to 
  the problem and an instance of the problem (a set S of integer a1…aN and
   an integer K) we will be able to identify (whether the solution is 
   correct or not) certificate in polynomial time. This can 
  be done by checking that the sum of the integers in subset S’ is equal to K.
