## RANDOMIZED ALGORITHM FOR PRIMALITY TEST

Many algorithms require large primes such as Universal Hashing and RSA public key cryptography.

We can find using (Lagrange Prime Number Theorem) that states that a random n bit
number has around a 1/n chance of being prime. So, if looking for a
random n bit prime, can just choose a random 1000 bit number and
check if it’s prime. After average O(n) steps will find a prime.

We have standard Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithms that works in O(√N ). The implementaiton for this algorithm as:
```
int n;
vector<bool> is_prime(n+1, true);
is_prime[0] = is_prime[1] = false;
for (int i = 2; i <= n; i++) {
    if (is_prime[i] && (long long)i * i <= n) {
        for (int j = i * i; j <= n; j += i)
            is_prime[j] = false;
    }
}
```
In which we start from 2 and start marking its multiple and make them as composite and we go as it is. And if it is not multiple of some number then it is going to be a prime number.
If number has 1000 bits, that’s 2√N time. Much too slow to be useful.

n this class we will see a Randomized Algorithm for checking primality
that will run in O(log N ) time (or O(log3 N ) bit operations).

### Monte carlo and Las vegas

There are two very different types of Randomized Algorithms

• Las-Vegas Algorithms: Algorithms always give correct answer but their running time is random.

• Monte Carlo Algorithms: Algorithm is deterministic but
only has a given probability of being correct. Can run algorithm many times to push probability of
correctness higher. The Rabin-Miller primality testing algorithm we will see,
will be a Monte Carlo Algorithm .

 #### Prime(p, a)

Input is p the number to check, and a, integer 1 < a < p.

- If p prime, then P rime(p, a) always returns **True**.
- If p composite, then P rime(p, a) may return **False** or **True**.
- f it returns **False**, a is a proof of compositeness.
- Less than 1/4 of a’s will return **True**.

Lemma: If p is composite then
∣∣{a : 1 < a < p and P rime(p, a) = T rue}∣∣≤ 1

**Prime(p, a)**:

Input is p the number to check, and a, integer 1 < a < p.

**Algorithm**:

For i = 1 to k
Choose a at random from {2, 3, . . . , p −1}

- If P rime(p, a) == False
- Return(p is composite with proof a).
- Return(p is Prime).
- If algorithm returns composite, the number is composite.
- If algorithm returns prime the algorithm is only wrong with probability (1/4)^k.
For reference, if k = 100, program has higher chance of being
wrong due to cosmic ray hitting computer memory than from always choosing bad a.

Prime(p, a)
- Write p−1 in form (2^t)u
- Can be done in O(log p) time by successive division by 2 (or looking at trailing 0s in base 2 representation)
- Calculate au mod p
- O(log u) = O(log p) time using repeated squarings, and then, using O(t) = O(log p) more squarings, calculate sequence
  a^u mod p, a^2u mod p, a^4u mod p, . . . , a2^tu = a^p−1 mod p

- If a^p−1 mod p 6 = 1 ⇒ Prime(p, a) = **False**

- If a^p−1 mod p == 1 and if ∃ s ≥1 s.t. (a^2s−1)u mod p 6≡1, −1 and a^2su mod p == 1
⇒ Prime(p, a) = **False**
  Else P rime(p, a) = **True**
