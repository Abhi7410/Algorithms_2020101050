## NUMBER THEORETIC ALGORITHMS

### GCD : EUCLID ALGORITHM

There are two given non-negative integers a and b , we have to find their GCD (greatest common divisor)
the largest number which is divisor of both a and b. It is commonly denoted by gcd(a,b).
In cpp there is inbuilt function that is reperesented as __gcd(a,b).
Mathematically it is defined as:
```
                gcd(a,b) =  max   k
                          k = 1..........infinty : k|a and k|b 
```
When one of the numbers is zero while the other is non zero their gcd by is the second number
When both numbers are zero, their gcd is undefined but we can degine it to be 0.
So we can conclude if one of the number if 0 then the gcd is other number.

Here we will se the Euclid algorithm to dind the gcd of two numbers a and b in O(log(min(a,b)))
.

The algorithm is as:

```
                gcd(a,b) = {
                                  a               if b=0
                                  gcd(b,a mod b)  otherwise
                           }
```
so simple implementaton of this algorithm will be
```
int gcd (int a, int b) {
    if (b == 0)
        return a;
    else
        return gcd (b, a % b);
}
```
We will understand how this algorithm works with one example and some explanation.
Suppose d as gcd of two numbers a and b. d = gcd(a,b)
```
                          a mod b = a -b*(floor(a/b))
                          Acc to the gcd definition a%d==0 and b%d==0
                       To show a mod b is also divided by d we only want to show it divided a-b
                       and this is already we know.
                          so this will hold that a mod b is also divided by defined
                          {
                            d|b,
                            d| (a mod b)
                          }
            Now we use the fact that for any three numbers x,y,z 
            if x|y and x|z then x | gcd(y,z).
```

Time complexity proof:

The running time of the algorithm is estimated b Lame theorem, which established a surprising
connection btw Eucledian and Fibonacci sequence.

The another prove is discusses in the class that is:
```
    Witness that either b>a/2 or b<=a/2 . If b<=a/2 then we have a mod b < b <= a/2 
    and if b > a/2 then a mod b = a-b < a/2.
    This shows that every time the next number passed for the gcd less then ot equal to half of it which makes the
    time complexity of the algorithm to be logarithmic.
```
## EXTENDED EUCLIDEAN ALGORITHM

This extended version finds a way to represent GCD in terms of a an b , i.e coefficients x and y for which 
  ```
                 ax +  by = gcd(a,b)
```

Starting from these coefficients (x,y)=(1,0) we can go backwards up the recursice calls. All we need to do is to figure out how the cieff x and y change
during the transition from (a,b) to (b,a mod b).
Le assum we found the coeff (x1,y1) fpr (b,a mod b):

                 b.x1+ (a mod b).y1 = g 
                 ax + by = g 
                 a mod b - a -[a/b].b 

                 g = a.y1 + b(x1-y1.floor(a/b)) 
                
                x = x1 and y = x1 - y1.floor(a/b)

```
int gcd(int a, int b, int& x, int& y) {
    if (b == 0) {
        x = 1;
        y = 0;
        return a;
    }
    int x1, y1;
    int d = gcd(b, a % b, x1, y1);
    x = y1;
    y = x1 - y1 * (a / b);
    return d;
}
```
From this extended version we also study the linear diophantine equation, A LDE is an equation of the general form 
```                
                        ax+by=c 
```  
where a,b,c are given integers and x,y are unknown integers. The algorithm helps in finding all solutions , the number of solutions, finding  a solution with min value of x+y.

### MODULAR DIVISON

A modular multiplicative incerse of an integer a is an intefer x such that a.x is congruent to 1 mosular some mosulus m. 
``` 
                                          ax --> 1 mod m 
``` 
We also denote x simply with a^-1. We should note that the modular inverse does not exist. For example let m = 4,a=2 . By checking all possible values modulo m is should become clear that we cannot find a-1 satisfying the above equation.
It can be proven tht the modular inverse exists if and onlu if a and m are relatively prime (gcd(a,m)=1).

by Linear diplophantine equation we can write the equation
                 ax + my = 1
                 taking modulo m both sides we can get rif of my.
                 int x, y;
```
int g = extended_euclidean(a, m, x, y);
if (g != 1) {
    cout << "No solution!";
}
else {
    x = (x % m + m) % m;
    cout << x << endl;
}
``` 
### Fermat Little theorem:-
  - If p is prime, then for every 1 <= a <= p, (a)^(p-1) = 1 (mod p).
  - The numbers a.i mod p are distinct
  - The numbers a.i mod p are distinct because if a.i - a.j(mod p), then dividing both sides by a yields i = j(mod p).
