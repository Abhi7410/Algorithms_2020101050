## DISCRETE FOURIER TRANSFORM(DFT)
Let there be a polynomial of degree :
```bash
    A(x)= a0+ a1x + a2x^2 + a3x^3 + .............+ an.x^(n-1)                
```
The discrete Fourier transform (DFT) of the polynomial 
  (or equivalently the vector of coefficients is defined as the values of the polynomial at the points.
The theory of complex numbers tells us that the equation x^n=1 has n complex solutions and the solutions
are of the form w^(2kpie)/n.We use DFT to find the product of two polynomials. The pocess using DFT
has time complexity of O(n^2) which is not considered good for large inputs. So we think to optimise the
solution , so new method is formed name FFT.

## FAST FOURIER TRANSFORM(FFT)
The fast Fourier transform is a method that allows computing the DFT in O(nlogn) time. 
The basic idea of the FFT is to apply divide and conquer. We divide the coefficient 
vector of the polynomial into two vectors, recursively compute the DFT for each of 
them, and combine the results to compute the DFT of the complete polynomial.
```bash
    A(x)= a0+ a1x + a2x^2 + a3x^3 + .............+ an.x^(n-1)                
```
We divide it into two smaller polynomials, the one containing only the coefficients of the even positions,
 and the one containing the coefficients of the odd positions.
 ```bash
    A(x)= A0(x^2) + xA1(x^2)                
```
 ```bash
 using cd = complex<double>;
const double PI = acos(-1);

void fft(vector<cd> & a, bool invert) {
    int n = a.size();
    if (n == 1)
        return;

    vector<cd> a0(n / 2), a1(n / 2);
    for (int i = 0; 2 * i < n; i++) {
        a0[i] = a[2*i];
        a1[i] = a[2*i+1];
    }
    fft(a0, invert);
    fft(a1, invert);

    double ang = 2 * PI / n * (invert ? -1 : 1);
    cd w(1), wn(cos(ang), sin(ang));
    for (int i = 0; 2 * i < n; i++) {
        a[i] = a0[i] + w * a1[i];
        a[i + n/2] = a0[i] - w * a1[i];
        if (invert) {
            a[i] /= 2;
            a[i + n/2] /= 2;
        }
        w *= wn;
    }
}
```
