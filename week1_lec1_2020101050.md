1.What is the meaning of problems in computational world?
--->*Computational thinking is the process of approaching a problem in a systematic manner and creating and expressing a solution such that it can be carried out by a computer. 
--->*We will learn different aspects to optimize problems , to think for different algorithms for same problem, how to approach for some specific case,
--->*how to find time complexity of some algorithms and relate it with optimization.
--->*We got some examples like prime number test , graph connectivity algo,boolean satisfiablity

2.What do you mean by solution?
--->*Best solution will be one who is better in time complexity(asymptotic analysic), space complexity analysis, worst case analysis.
