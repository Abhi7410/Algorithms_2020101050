# WEEK-2 LECTURE-2
## DIVIDE AND CONQUER:-
 - To multiply two n-digit integers:-
    1. Add two n/2 digit-integers.
    2. Multiply three (n/2)-digit integers. 
    3. Add, subtract and shift (1/2)n-digit integers to obtain result.
    4. MASTER theorem and it's proof using logic tree.

## Merge-Sort:-
  - An O(nlogn) comparison sort
  - Idea:-
      Split the array into two halves and recursily sort each half.
      Then merge the two sorted sub-lists.
  - Merge does a constant amount of work per recursive call which are O(k + 1) calls.
  - And hence merge is indeed linear in n.
  - Time complexity :- O(nlogn)
  - k is atleast log2(n!)
  - Note that there are n! permutations (from 0 to n!-1)..
  - Merge sort is optimal.
  
## Matrix Multiplication:-
  - Naive: O(n^3)
    n * n for multiplication, n for writing it in another matrix resulting in n^3.
  
  - Divide and Conquer:-
    Breaking the matrix into 8 matrix of n/2-sized product.
    Leading into a T(n) = 8T(n/2) + O(n^2) thus entailing O(n^3).
    
  - Strassen's Algorithm:-
      Step 1:- Recursively compute only 7 products.
      Step 2:- Do the necessary additions and subtractions (((theta)n^2) time).
      
      It's better than cubic time as per Master Method.
      Time complexity:- O(n^(2.81))

## Median:-
  - Input: An array of numbers A; and integer k
  - Output: The kth smallest element of A
  
  - Naive: O(nlogn) steps by sorting the array and find the (k-1)th index element from the array/
  
  - Divide and Conquer:-
    ```bash
      Elements smaller than v  
      Those equal to v         
      Those greater than v.    
    ```
    Recursion:
       -              { selection(Sl,k)                  if k <= |Sl|
       -                selection(S,k)={ v               if |Sl| < k <= |Sl| + |Sv|
                     { selection(Sr, k- |Sl|-|Sv|)      if k > |Sl| + |Sv|
      Choosing v:-
       - Deterministic approach:-
          - Median of medians
  
            1. Divide the n elements into groups of 5.
            2. Find the median of each of the n/5 groups.
            3. Find the median x of the n/5 medians.
          - Time complexity: O(n)
