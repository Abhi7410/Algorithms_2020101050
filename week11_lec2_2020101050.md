## SHOR ALGORITHM

Shor's algorithm is a quantum algorithm for factoring a number N in O((log N)3) 
time and O(log N) space, named after Peter Shor.

Like all quantum computer algorithms, Shor's algorithm is probabilistic: it gives the correct answer with high probability, 
and the probability of failure can be decreased by repeating the algorithm.

**Procedure**

The algorithm mainly consists of two parts:

    1. A reduction of the factoring problem to the problem of order-finding, which can be done on a classical computer.
    2. A quantum algorithm to solve the order-finding problem.

**Classical part**

- Pick a pseudo-random number a < N
-  Compute gcd(a, N). This may be done using the Euclidean algorithm.
-  If gcd(a, N) ≠ 1, then there is a nontrivial factor of N, so we are done.
-  Otherwise, use the period-finding subroutine (below) to find r, the period of the following function:
-  f(x) = ax mod N  , i.e. the smallest integer r for which f(x + r) = f(x).
-  If r is odd, go back to step 1.
-  If a r/2 ≡ -1 (mod N), go back to step 1.
-  The factors of N are gcd(ar/2 ± 1, N). We are done.

**Period fiding**

- Start with a pair of input and output qubit registers with log2N qubits each, and initialize them to
  N − 1/2∑x∣x⟩∣0⟩  where x runs from 0 to N - 1.
-  Construct f(x) as a quantum function and apply it to the above state, to obtain
   N − 1/2∑x∣x⟩∣f(x)⟩
-  Apply the quantum Fourier transform on the input register. The quantum Fourier transform on N points is defined by:
```
   UQFT∣x⟩ = N − 1/2∑ye2πixy/N∣y⟩
   ```
   This leaves us in the following state:
```
  N − 1∑x∑ye2πixy/N∣y⟩∣f(x)⟩
  ```
-  Perform a measurement. We obtain some outcome y in the input register and f(x0) in the output register. Since f is periodic, the probability to measure some y is given by
```
    N − 1∣∑x :  f(x) = f(x0)e2πixy/N∣2 = N − 1∣∑be2πi(x0 + rb)y/N∣2
```
-  Analysis now shows that this probability is higher, the closer yr/N is to an integer.
-  Turn y/N into an irreducible fraction, and extract the denominator r′, which is a candidate for r.
- Check if f(x) = f(x + r′). If so, we are done.
- Otherwise, obtain more candidates for r by using values near y, or multiples of r′. If any candidate works, we are done.
- Otherwise, go back to step 1 of the subroutine.
