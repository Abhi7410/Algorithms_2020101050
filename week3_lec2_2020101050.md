## GREEDY ALGORITHMS
- GRAPHS: MINIMUM SPANNING TREE
A spanning tree of a graph consists of all nodes of the graph and some of the
edges of the graph so that there is a path between any two nodes. Like trees
in general, spanning trees are connected and acyclic.A minimum spanning tree is a
 spanning tree whose weight is as small as possible.
    
 - Naive approach:
     1. Enumerating all the exponential possibilities of spanning tree.
     2. Can take huge amount of time and resources.


- Kruskal’s algorithm
The initial spanning tree only contains the nodes of
the graph and does not contain any edges. Then the algorithm goes through the
edges ordered by their weights, and always adds an edge to the tree if it does not
create a cycle.
The algorithm maintains the components of the tree. Initially, each node of
the graph belongs to a separate component. Always when an edge is added to the
tree, two components are joined. Finally, all nodes belong to the same component,
and a minimum spanning tree has been found.
```bash
     
    struct Edge {
    int u, v, weight;
    bool operator<(Edge const& other) {
        return weight < other.weight;
    }
};

    int n;
    vector<Edge> edges;

    int cost = 0;
    vector<int> tree_id(n);
    vector<Edge> result;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
        tree_id[i] = i;

    sort(edges.begin(), edges.end());

    for (Edge e : edges) {
        if (tree_id[e.u] != tree_id[e.v]) {
            cost += e.weight;
            result.push_back(e);

            int old_id = tree_id[e.u], new_id = tree_id[e.v];
            for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
                if (tree_id[i] == old_id)
                    tree_id[i] = new_id;
            }
        }
    }

```
## CUT PROPERTY
According to the cut property, if there is an edge in the cut set which has the smallest edge weight or cost among all
other edges in the cut set, the edge should be included in the minimum spanning tree.
Shortest path algorithms like Prim’s algorithm and Kruskal’s algorithm use the cut property to construct a minimum spanning tree.
  - Suppose edges X are part of a minimium spanning tree of G = (V,E). 
  - Pick any subset of nodes S for which X does not cross between S and V-S, 
  - Let e be the lightest edge across this partition, Then X union {E} is part of some MST.
  - Proof of this was present in slides and was thoroughly explained.
  - We use disjoint set data structure for Kruskal's algo.
  - Procedure:
      1. Creating a singleton set containing just x then we sort all the edges by its weight. O(1)
      2. Using the concept of ranks by declaring a paretn pointer pi, where rank(x) = 0 when pi(x) = x. O(logn)
      3. Finding the set in which X belongs by running a while loop as: 
 
                while(x != pi(x))
                x = pi(x);
                return x;
              
          
    4. Taking union for all the edges {x,y} belonging to E, if find(x) != find(y)  O(logn)
            then we add/merge the sets containing x and y.
            Function:
              
              let rx = find(x) and ry = find(y)
              if rx != ry: if rank(x) > rank(y) then pi(ry) = rx, if rank(x) < rank(y) then pi(rx) = ry
              and if rank(x) = rank(y) then rank(ry) = ranl(rx) + 1;
              

          
          **Current time complexity is o(|E| + |v|)(log |v|).**
          
     5. Modifications:-
     While finding, when a series of parent pointers is followed up to the root of a tree, 
     We will change all these pointers so that they point directly to the root.
          
    - Hence:
         1. Either the rank of parent(x) is in a higher interval than the rank of x
         2. Else it lies in the same interval.
        
        - After understanding, the overall complexity for m find's is 0(mlog*n) + 2^k*no of nodes with rank>k <= nlog*n.
        - Thus Kruskal’s Algorithm using Disjoint-Sets data structure with path compression runs with the 
          complexity of: “**Sorting |E| elements**” + (O(|E| log*|V|)).
