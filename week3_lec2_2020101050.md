## GREEDY ALGORITHMS
- GRAPHS: MINIMUM SPANNING TREE
A spanning tree of a graph consists of all nodes of the graph and some of the
edges of the graph so that there is a path between any two nodes. Like trees
in general, spanning trees are connected and acyclic.A minimum spanning tree is a
 spanning tree whose weight is as small as possible.

 In Kruskal’s algorithm, the initial spanning tree only contains the nodes of
the graph and does not contain any edges. Then the algorithm goes through the
edges ordered by their weights, and always adds an edge to the tree if it does not
create a cycle.
The algorithm maintains the components of the tree. Initially, each node of
the graph belongs to a separate component. Always when an edge is added to the
tree, two components are joined. Finally, all nodes belong to the same component,
and a minimum spanning tree has been found.
```bash
     
    struct Edge {
    int u, v, weight;
    bool operator<(Edge const& other) {
        return weight < other.weight;
    }
};

    int n;
    vector<Edge> edges;

    int cost = 0;
    vector<int> tree_id(n);
    vector<Edge> result;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
        tree_id[i] = i;

    sort(edges.begin(), edges.end());

    for (Edge e : edges) {
        if (tree_id[e.u] != tree_id[e.v]) {
            cost += e.weight;
            result.push_back(e);

            int old_id = tree_id[e.u], new_id = tree_id[e.v];
            for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
                if (tree_id[i] == old_id)
                    tree_id[i] = new_id;
            }
        }
    }

```
## CUT PROPERTY
According to the cut property, if there is an edge in the cut set which has the smallest edge weight or cost among all
 other edges in the cut set, the edge should be included in the minimum spanning tree.
Shortest path algorithms like Prim’s algorithm and Kruskal’s algorithm use the cut property to construct a minimum spanning tree.
