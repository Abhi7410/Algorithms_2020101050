## GREEDY ALGORITHM

### ----------------------------------------------SET COVER------------------------------------------

#### What is it?
We must select a minimum number [of any size set] of such sets so
 that the sets you have picked contain all the elements that are contained
 in any of the sets in the input. Additionally, we want to minimize the cost of the sets. 

 ```bash
    A universe U = {u1,u2,u3,u4.....}
    Subsets S1,S2,S3,S4 of universe
    Costs c1,c2,c3...
  ```
  #### Goal

  We have to find a set that minimise the total and such that union of subsets is 
  equal to the universe.
  #### Undirected Graph: 
An undirected graph G = (V,E) is a set system where V constitutes
the universe, and the edges E are subsets of cardinality two.
#### Geometric set systems: 
The universe consists of n points in space, and the sets are the
subsets of points that are contained within some specified geometric shape (balls, cubes,
rectangles, triangles, etc.)
#### Wireless Coverage: 
The universe consists all the locations on a college campus, and for
each possible location of a wireless transmitter there is an associated region of the campus
that is covered by placing a wireless transmitter at this location.

It was one of Karp's NP complete problems , shown to be in so 1972. Interesting examples
are IBM finds computer viruses .
#### Approach
1. Greedy Algorithm:
- A simple greedy approach to set cover works by at each stage selecting the set that covers the greatest number of uncovered elements. 
- The set C contains the indices of the sets of the cover, and the set U stores the elements of X that are still uncovered. Initially, C is empty and U <- X.
- We repeatedly select the set of S that covers the greatest number of elements of U and add it to the cover.

```bash

Greedy-Set-Cover(X, S)
 {
           U = X // U stores the uncovered items
           C = empty // C stores the sets of the cover
       while (U is nonempty) 
       {
           select s[i] in S that covers the most elements of U
           add i to C
           remove the elements of s[i] from U
       }
       return C
 }
```
The problem with this approach is that it can be fooled in picking the wrong set,
over and over again which leads to wrong answer. The example we discussed in the class
which was {1,2,3,4,5,6} is the universal set.
{1,2,3,4},{1,3,5} and {2,4,6}. If we go by greedy approach then we will choose the first one
and then second and then third which results in choosing all the three subsets. But we can work out in
2 sets by choosing last two. So it doesn't not work always.

We discussed the proof of this and time complexity for this.
The greedy set cover is larger than optimal set cover by a factor at most ln(m) where m is total no. of
initial elements.
