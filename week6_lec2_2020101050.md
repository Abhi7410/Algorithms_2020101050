## CHAIN MATRIX MULTIPLICATION

#### MATRIX MULTIPLICATION: 
We have two matrices A and B so the condition for the multiplying of matrices
is that in AxB the no. of columns of A is equal to the no. of rows of B. A is r1xc1 then B should be c1xr2 then 
resultant matrix will be of order r1xr2. It is associative in nature so A1x(A2xA3) = (A1xA2)xA3.
if above condition holds.

#### WHAT IS CHAIN MATRIX MULTIPLICATION?
When we muptiply two matrices the total no. of multiplication process takes as:
Suppose we have A (r1xc1) and B(r2xc2) matrices then AxB (r1xc2) . The total products are going to be
r1xc1xc2 , So for optimally solution we will try to find less to less product . In chain mulpticaiton we will choose those two matricess
which will give less one.

Example:
```bash
Input: p[] = {40, 20, 30, 10, 30}   
Output: 26000  
There are 4 matrices of dimensions 40x20, 20x30, 30x10 and 10x30.
Let the input 4 matrices be A, B, C and D.  The minimum number of 
multiplications are obtained by putting parenthesis in following way
(A(BC))D --> 20*30*10 + 40*20*10 + 40*10*30

Input: p[] = {10, 20, 30, 40, 30} 
Output: 30000 
There are 4 matrices of dimensions 10x20, 20x30, 30x40 and 40x30. 
Let the input 4 matrices be A, B, C and D.  The minimum number of 
multiplications are obtained by putting parenthesis in following way
((AB)C)D --> 10*20*30 + 10*30*40 + 10*40*30

Input: p[] = {10, 20, 30}  
Output: 6000  
There are only two matrices of dimensions 10x20 and 20x30. So there 
is only one way to multiply the matrices, cost of which is 10*20*30
```

We can see same subproblems are called again and again so we can implement Dynamic programming 
implementation of it. 
Recomputations of same subproblems can be avoided by constructing a temporary array m[][] in bottom up manner.


- If there are n matrices in the chain then we can put parathesis in 2*(n-1)C(n-1) ways.
Following is the recursive algorithm to find the minimum cose:
- Take the sequence of matrices and separate it into two subsequence.
- Find the min cost od multiplying out each subsequence/
- Add these costs together and ass in the price os multiplying the two result matrices.
- Do this for each possible position at which the sequence of matrices can be spilt and take the minimum over all of them.





This is recursive approact which has time exponential time complexity.
```bash
int matrixChainMultiplication(int dims[], int i, int j)
{
    
    if (j <= i + 1) {
        return 0;
    }
    int min = INT_MAX;
 
    /*
        (M[i+1]) × (M[i+2]………………M[j])
        (M[i+1]M[i+2]) × (M[i+3…………M[j])
        …
        …
        (M[i+1]M[i+2]…………M[j-1]) × (M[j])
    */
 
    for (int k = i + 1; k <= j - 1; k++)
    {
        // recur for `M[i+1]…M[k]` to get an `i × k` matrix
        int cost = matrixChainMultiplication(dims, i, k);
 
        // recur for `M[k+1]…M[j]` to get an `k × j` matrix
        cost += matrixChainMultiplication(dims, k, j);
 
        // cost to multiply two `i × k` and `k × j` matrix
        cost +=    dims[i] * dims[k] * dims[j];
 
        if (cost < min) {
            min = cost;
        }
    }

    return min;
}
```


#### Dp approach

**(Formula: Cost[i,j] = (min{cost[i,k]+cost[k+1,j]+d[i-1]xd[k]xd[j]))**
***i<=k<=j***
- The matrix with single size or single mutilple will have cose 0 so in first step we do A[i][i]=0.
- Then tabulating for small vaules so the costs will be stored for the next ones .

```bash

int matrixChainMultiplication(int dims[], int n)
{
    
    int c[n + 1][n + 1];
 
    for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
        c[i][i] = 0;   //single multiple
    }
 
    for (int len = 2; len <= n; len++)        // subsequence lengths
    {
        for (int i = 1; i <= n - len + 1; i++)
        {
            int j = i + len - 1;
            c[i][j] = INT_MAX;
 
            for (int k = i; j < n && k <= j - 1; k++)
            {
                int cost = c[i][k] + c[k + 1][j] + dims[i - 1] * dims[k] * dims[j];//following the formula here
                if (cost < c[i][j]) {
                    c[i][j] = cost;
                }
            }
        }
    }
    return c[1][n - 1];
}
 ```

## KNAPSACK PROBLEM

The term knapsack refers to problems where a set of objects is given, and
subsets with some properties have to be found. Knapsack problems can often be
solved using dynamic programming.
In this section, we focus on the following problem: Given a list of weights
[ w 1 , w 2 , . . . , w n ], determine all sums that can be constructed using the weights.
For example, if the weights are [1, 3, 3, 5], the following sums are possible:
```
0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12
X X   X X X X X X X     X  X 
```
In this case, all sums between 0 . . . 12 are possible, except 2 and 10. For
example, the sum 7 is possible because we can select the weights [1, 3, 3].

To solve the problem, we focus on subproblems where we only use the first k
weights to construct sums. Let possible ( x, k ) = true if we can construct a sum x
using the first k weights, and otherwise possible ( x, k ) = false. The values of the
function can be recursively calculated as follows:
possible ( x, k ) = possible ( x − w k , k − 1) ∨ possible ( x, k − 1).

This tabulation formula is based on the fact that we can either
use or not use the weight wk in the sum. If we use w k , the remaining task is to form the sum x − w k using the
first k − 1 weights, and if we do not use w k , the remaining task is to form the sum
x using the first k − 1 weights. As the base cases,
``` 
                      possible(x,0) = { true x=0
                                      { false x!= 0
```
because if no weights are used, we can only form the sum 0.

#### 0-1 KNACPSACK PROBLEM

There will be given wrights and values of n items , we have to put these itmes in knapsach of capacity W to get the max total value in th knapsack 
. In other words, given two integer arrays val[0..n-1] and wt[0..n-1] which represent values and weights associated with n items respectively. Also given an integer W which represents knapsack capacity, find out the maximum value subset of val[] such that sum of the weights of this subset is smaller than or equal to W. You cannot break an item, either pick the
 complete item or don’t pick it (0-1 property).

 In Dp Approach,a DP[][] table let’s consider all the possible weights from ‘1’ to ‘W’ as the columns and weights that can be kept as the rows. 
The state DP[i][j] will denote maximum value of ‘j-weight’ considering all values from ‘1 to ith’. So if we consider ‘wi’ (weight in ‘ith’ row) we can fill it in all columns which have ‘weight values > wi’. Now two possibilities can take place: 
- Fill 'wi' in the given column.
- Do not fill 'wi' in the given column.
Then we will take max of these two possibilites, formallu if we do not fill ith weight in jth column then DP[i][j] state will be same as DP[i-1][j]
but if we fill the weight , DP[i][j] we be equal to the valye of 'w'  value of the column weighing 'j-wi' in the previous row. So we take the maximum of these two possibilitied to fill the current state.
